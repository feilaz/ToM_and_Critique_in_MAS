# SynergyMAS: Enhancing LLM Capabilities for Complex Tasks

## Introduction

SynergyMAS is a Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex tasks. It integrates logical reasoning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Theory of Mind (ToM) to overcome common LLM limitations.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for the SynergyMAS framework
- `agents.py`: Definitions and implementations of specialized agents
- `rag.py`: Retrieval-Augmented Generation system
- `tools.py`: Knowledge base system and logical reasoning tools
- `config_loader.py`: Configuration management
- `prompts.py`: System prompts for agents

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Neo4j Database
- OpenAI API key
- LangChain API key (optional, for tracing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up your Neo4j database and note down the connection details.
This can be done at: https://sandbox.neo4j.com/

## Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:

2. Edit `config.ini` with your specific settings:
- Add your OpenAI API key
- Set your Neo4j database connection details
- Configure paths for RAG data and Chroma DB
- Set LangChain tracing options (if used)

## Preparing RAG Data

Place your profession-specific data in the following directories:
- `rag/MRA/`: Market Research Analyst data
- `rag/PD/`: Product Designer data
- `rag/SM/`: Sales Manager data

## Running the Program

Execute the main script with your problem statement:

python main.py "Your problem statement here"

For example:
python main.py """Analyze the Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) MVP 6-week trial data:
